                    <p>Alberta is one of the thirteen provinces and territories of Canada. It is part of Western Canada
                        and is one of the three prairie provinces. Alberta is bordered by British Columbia to the west,
                        Saskatchewan to the east, the Northwest Territories (NWT) to the north, and the U.S. state of
                        Montana to the south. It is one of the only two landlocked provinces in Canada. The eastern part
                        of the province is occupied by the Great Plains, while the western part borders the Rocky
                        Mountains. The province has a predominantly continental climate but experiences quick
                        temperature changes due to air aridity. Seasonal temperature swings are less pronounced in
                        western Alberta due to occasional chinook winds.</p>
                    <p>Size of the territory: 661,848 km2 (sixth place in Canada).</p>
                    <p>Percentage of the area of Canada - 6.6 %. </p>
                    <p>Coat of Arms of Alberta - symbolizes the role of Canada (beaver), Great Britain (crown) and the
                        Confederation (helmet) in the history of Alberta. On both sides, the shield is supported by a
                        royal lion and a horned antelope.</p>
                    <p>The motto of the province – "Strong and free”.</p>
                    <p>Flag of Alberta: the main field of the flag is blue, in the center there is a shield, which is
                        the basis of the coat of arms. In the upper part of the shield there is a cross of St. George
                        (red on a white background). At the bottom, on a blue background, there are three snow-covered
                        peaks symbolizing the Canadian Rocky Mountains, green hills, prairies and wheat fields, which
                        together represent the landscape characteristic of Alberta.</p>
                    <p>Main cities: Edmonton, Calgary, Lethbridge, Red Deer, Medicine Hat, St. Albert, Fort McMurray,
                        Grand Prairie.</p>
                    <p>Flower - wild rose (rosehip).</p>
                    <p>Tree - long-needle pine.</p>
                    <p>Bird symbol: Big horned owl.</p>
                    <p>The oil and gas industry is also a part of the province's identity. Alberta's economy is based on
                        hydrocarbons, petrochemical industries, livestock, agriculture and frontier technologies. The
                        oil industry has been a pillar of Alberta's economy since 1947, when substantial oil deposits
                        were discovered at Leduc No. 1 well. Since Alberta is the province most rich in hydrocarbons, it
                        provides 70% of the oil and natural gas exploited on Canadian soil. In 2018, Alberta's output
                        was CDN$338.2 billion, 15.27% of Canada's GDP.</p>
                    <p>In the past, Alberta's political landscape hosted parties like the left-wing Liberals and the
                        agrarian United Farmers of Alberta. Today, Alberta is generally perceived as a conservative
                        province. The right-wing Social Credit Party held office continually from 1935 to 1971 before
                        the centre-right Progressive Conservatives held office continually from 1971 to 2015, the latter
                        being the longest unbroken run in government at the provincial or federal level in Canadian
                        history.</p>
                    <p>Before becoming part of Canada, Alberta was home to several First Nations and was a territory
                        used by fur traders of the Hudson's Bay Company. Canada acquired the lands that would become
                        Alberta as part of the NWT on July 15, 1870. On September 1, 1905, Alberta was separated from
                        the NWT as a result of the Alberta Act and designated the 8th province of Canada. From the late
                        1800s to early 1900s, many immigrants arrived, the biggest wave of which was pushed by Wilfrid
                        Laurier, to prevent the prairies from being annexed by the United States. Massive oil resources
                        were discovered in Alberta in 1947.</p>
                    <p>Alberta was named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta (1848–1939), the fourth daughter of
                        Queen Victoria. Princess Louise was the wife of John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, Governor
                        General of Canada (1878–83). Lake Louise and Mount Alberta were also named in her honour.

                        The name "Alberta" itself is a feminine Latinized form of Albert, the name of Princess Louise's
                        father, the Prince Consort (cf. Medieval Latin: Albertus, masculine) and its Germanic cognates,
                        ultimately derived from the Proto-Germanic language *Aþalaberhtaz (compound of "noble" +
                        "bright/famous").</p>
